Ask the user for the project name. It must be lowercase, no spaces. Use that in [app.json](mdc:app.json) and [package.json](mdc:package.json). Make up the slug yourself. Ask the user if they have a domain. If they do, use that in [app.json](mdc:app.json) for the bundleIdentifier and package ID. If not, make something up.

Then, based on the info so far, update [README.md](mdc:README.md)


Finally, delete this file [first-time-setup.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/first-time-setup.mdc) (`.cursor/rules/first-time-setup.mdc`)
